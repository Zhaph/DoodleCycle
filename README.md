Windows Phone 7 Cycle Ride Tracker

Having looked at a few ride tracking apps on Windows Phone, I felt they tended to be lacking a few areas - some were all in metric measurements, with lots of requests to add imperial, while others were the opposite.

The first version of DoodleCycle allows you to choose between miles and kilometres for distance travelled, and independently between metres and feet for elevation gained.

Other features include a Trial mode (rides are limited to 10 minutes), running in background, error logging and more.

Designed to conform to the Windows Phone Design Guidelines, the app fits right in on your phone.
